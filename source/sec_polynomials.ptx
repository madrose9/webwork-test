    <p>
      A <term>polynomial</term> is a function described by an expression of the form <m>f(x)=a_nx^n + \cdots + a_1x+a_0</m>,
      where <m>a_0, a_1,\ldots,a_n</m> are real numbers and <m>n\geq0</m> is an integer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expressions <m>a_n x^n, a_{n-1}x^{n-1}, \ldots, a_1x,
      a_0</m> are called the <em>terms</em>
      of the polynomial <m>f</m>.
      For each integer <m>k = 0, 1, \ldots, n</m>,
      the number <m>a_k</m> is called the <term>coefficient</term>
      of <m>x^k</m> in the polynomial <m>f</m>.
      The number <m>a_0</m> is called the
      <em>constant term</em> of <m>f</m>.
      Notice that <m>a_0 = a_0 x^0</m>,
      so that <m>a_0</m> is the coefficient of <m>x^0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>f(x) =a_nx^n + \cdots + a_1x+a_0</m> be a polynomial in which at least one of the coefficients is not zero.
      Then, the <em>degree</em> of <m>f</m> is the largest integer <m>k</m> such that the coefficient of <m>x^k</m> is not zero.
      (Notice that such an integer <m>k</m> is guaranteed to exist.)
      In this case, <m>a_kx^k</m> is the
      <em>leading term</em> of <m>f</m>,
      and <m>a_k</m> is the <em>leading coefficient</em> of <m>f</m>.
      Since <m>a_0 = a_0 x^0</m>,
      it is possible for a polynomial to have degree zero.
    </p>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(x)=2x^3-10x+9</m>.
          Then,

            <li>
              <p>
                the terms of <m>f</m> are <m>2x^3</m>,

    <p>
      The polynomial in which all coefficients are zero,
      that is <m>f(x) = 0 + 0x + 0x^2 \cdots</m>,
      is called <em>the zero polynomial</em>.
      It is the only polynomial for which the degree is undefined.
    </p>
    <p>
      An <em>important fact</em> is that if <m>f(x)</m> is a polynomial,
      then <m>f(a)=0</m> if and only if <m>(x-a)</m> divides <m>f(x)</m>.
      In other words,
      <m>a</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>f(x)</m> if and only if <m>(x-a)</m> is a factor of <m>f(x)</m>.
      Hence to check whether <m>x-a</m> is a factor of <m>f(x)</m>,
      check whether <m>f(a) = 0</m>.
      Conversely, if <m>f(a) = 0</m> then <m>(x-a)</m> is a factor of <m>f(x)</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(x)=2x^3+x^2 -1</m>.
          Then,
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>x-1</m> is not a factor of <m>f(x)</m> because <m>1</m> is not a root of <m>f(x)</m>.
                We can calculate <m>f(1) = 2 \neq 0</m>;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>x+1 = x- (-1)</m> is a factor of <m>f(x)</m> because <m>f(-1) = 0</m>.
                In fact, <m>f(x) = (x+1)(2x^2 - x + 1)</m>.
                We can check this by multiplication <m>(x+1)(2x^2 - x + 1) = 2x^3 - x^2 + x + 2x^2 - x - 1 = 2x^3+x^2 -1</m>.
                (The factors in this expression can be found by long division,
                as discussed below.)
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      A <em>useful fact</em> is that if a polynomial <m>f(x)</m> has leading coefficient equal to 1, then an integer <m>a</m> can be a root of <m>f(x)</m> only if <m>a</m> or <m>-a</m> is a divisor of the constant term <m>a_0</m>.
      It may be that all,
      some, or none of these are actually roots of <m>f</m>.
      Also, <m>f</m> may have roots that are not integers.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex8">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(x)=x^3-x^2-2x+2</m>.
          Since the leading coefficient of <m>f</m> is 1, the only possible integers which could possibly be roots of <m>f</m> are the divisors of 2 and their negatives,
          that is <m>1, -1, 2</m>, and <m>-2</m>.
          Of these possibilities,
          only <m>1</m> is a root (because <m>f(1) = 0</m> whereas
          <m>f(-1),
          f(2)</m> and <m>f(-2)</m> are all non-zero).
          In fact, <m>f(x) = (x-1)(x^2 - 2)</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Once we know a root of a polynomial,
      we can factor the polynomial using long division.
      Polynomials are divided just like numbers.
      We saw in <xref ref="ex8">Example</xref>
      that 1 is a root of <m>f(x)=x^3-x^2-2x+2</m>,
      so we can divide <m>f(x)</m> by <m>x-1</m>: \polylongdiv{x^3-x^2-2x+2}{x-1} Because the remainder is <m>0</m>,
      this means that <m>x^3-x^2-2x+2=(x-1)(x^2-2)</m>.
      We can factor further,
      because <m>(x^2-2) = (x-\sqrt{2})(x+\sqrt{2})</m>, so:
      <me>
        f(x)=(x-1)\left(x-\sqrt{2}\right)\left(x+\sqrt{2}\right)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since a product of numbers equals zero if and only if one of them is zero,
      <m>f(x)=0</m> if and only if <m>x-1=0</m> or
      <m>x-\sqrt{2}=0</m> or <m>x+\sqrt{2}=0</m>,
      and so the roots of <m>f(x)</m> are <m>-1</m>,
      <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and <m>-\sqrt{2}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For any number <m>x</m> in its domain,
      and expression represents a number.
      If we remember that <m>x</m> just represents a number in the domain,
      then expressions involving a variable can be factored
      (using the commutative, associative and distributive laws).
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex9">
      <statement>
        <me>
          \begin{array}{rcl}
          2x(x+1)+(x+1)^2 \amp =\amp  2x(x+1)+(x+1)(x+1) \\
          \amp =\amp  (x+1)[2x+(x+1)] \\
          \amp =\amp  (x+1)(3x+1).
          \end{array}

          \begin{array}{rcl}
          4x(x+1)^3-6x^2(x+1)^2   \amp =\amp  2x(x+1)^2[2(x+1)-3x]\\
          \amp =\amp  2x(x+1)^2[2-x].
          \end{array}
        </me>

    <p>
      Notice that,
      in <xref ref="ex9">Examples</xref> and <xref ref="ex10"></xref>,
      factoring would have been much more difficult if the expression had been multiplied out.
      Sometimes factoring requires creatively grouping the terms.

          \amp =\amp  (1+x^2)[8x+x^4]\\
