  <introduction>
    <p>
      Let <m>D</m> be a set of real numbers.
      Any way of associating exactly one real number with each element of <m>D</m> is called a <term>function</term>.
      The set <m>D</m> is called the function's <term>domain</term>.
      For any <m>x</m> in <m>D</m>,
      we call <m>f(x)</m> the <em>value of <m>f</m> at <m>x</m></em>.
      The set <m>\{f(x) : x \mbox{ is in }  D\} = \{y:
      y = f(x) \mbox{ for some }</m>x<m>\mbox{ in }  D\}</m> is called the function's
      <term>range</term> <mdash/> that is,
      the range of <m>f</m> is the set of all numbers that occur as values of <m>f</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the function <m>f</m> is described by giving a formula,
      then for any number in the domain the value of <m>f</m> at that number is obtained by substituting that number for the variable in the formula.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if the function <m>f</m> is described by
      <m>f(x) = 5x^2 - x +1</m> and the domain is the set of all real numbers,
      <m>\mathbb{R}</m>,
      then to find <m>f(2)</m> we substitute 2 into the formula for <m>x</m>, as in:
      <me>
        f(2) = 5(2)^2 - (2) + 1 = 5 \cdot 4 - 2 + 1 = 20 - 2 + 1 = 19
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, <m>f(2) = 19</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Assumed domains</em>.
      When the domain <m>D</m> is not explicitly given in the description of the function,
      we assume it is the largest collection of numbers for which the function makes sense
      (is defined).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Finding the range</em>.
      When finding the range of a function that's described by an expression,
      there are usually two steps involved.
      The first step is to determine a set of possible values the function could take.
      The second step is to verify that each one of these is actually achieved for at least one <m>x</m> in the domain.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For each function, find the assumed domain <m>D</m>, that is,
          the largest collection of numbers for which the function is defined.
          In addition, find the range of the function.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>f(x) = x^2 -5</m>.
                The expression <m>x^2 - 5</m> is defined for all real numbers,
                so assumed domain is the set of all real numbers, <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.
                Since, for every real number <m>x</m>,
                the quantity <m>x^2</m> is at least zero,
                <m>x^2-5</m> is at least <m>0-5 = -5</m>.
                Therefore the possible numbers that can be in the range are the real numbers which are at least <m>-5</m>.
                Take any <m>y \geq -5</m>.
                Then <m>y = x^2 - 5</m> if and only if <m>y+5 = x^2</m>,
                and <m>y + 5 \geq 0</m> so <m>x = \pm \sqrt{y + 5}</m>.
                Hence there is always at least one number <m>x</m> the domain such that <m>f(x) = y</m>,
                so the range is <m>\{ y : y \geq -5 \}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>f(x) = \sqrt{x-5} + 3</m>.
                The expression <m>\sqrt{x-5} + 3</m> involves a square root,
                and the square root function only makes sense for non-negative numbers
                (it is only defined for non-negative numbers).
                That means we need to have <m>x -5 \geq 0</m>,
                or equivalently <m>x \geq 5</m>.
                There are no other restrictions on the values of <m>x</m> that can be used.
                Therefore, the domain is <m>\{ x : x \geq 5\}</m>.
                Since for every <m>x \geq 5</m> the quantity <m>\sqrt{x-5} \geq 0</m>,
                we know that <m>\sqrt{x-5} + 3 \geq 0+3 = 3</m>.
                Therefore the possible numbers that can be in the range are the real numbers which are at least <m>3</m>.
                Take any <m>y \geq 3</m>.
                Then <m>y = \sqrt{x-5} + 3</m> if and only if <m>y - 3 = \sqrt{x-5}</m>,
                which implies <m>(y-3)^2 = x-5</m>.
                Thus, if <m>f(x) = y</m> then <m>x = (y-3)^2 + 5</m>.
                Since <m>y \geq 3</m>, the quantity <m>(y-3)^2 + 5</m> is in the domain.
                Furthermore, if <m>x = (y-3)^2 + 5</m>, then
                <me>
                  f(x) = f((y-3)^2 + 5) = \sqrt{(y-3)^2 + 5 -5} + 3 = \sqrt{(y-3)^2} + 3 = |y-3| + 3  = (y-3) + 3 = y
                </me>.
                We've used <m>|y-3| = y-3</m> because <m>y - 3 \geq 0</m>.
                Therefore,  the range is <m>\{ y : y \geq 3 \}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      A function can be defined by an equation.
      For example, for the equation <m>y = 10x - 7</m>,
      once we choose a value for <m>x</m>,
      then <m>y</m> is uniquely determined:
      as in the definition of a function,
      the equation <m>y = 10x - 7</m> associates exactly one number <m>y</m> with each number <m>x</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Does the equation <m>x=y^2+5</m> define <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>?
        </p>
        <p>
          No.
          For example, when <m>x=6</m>,
          the statements <m>6 = (-1)^2 + 5</m> and <m>6 = 1^2 + 5</m> are both true.
          Thus this equation associates two values of <m>y</m>,
          namely <m>\pm 1</m>, with <m>x = 6</m>,
          and so it does not define <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>.
